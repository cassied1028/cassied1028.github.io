        <p class="about-p">Hello, I'm Cassie! I am from <span>Easton, MA</span>. I received my <span>Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science</span> with a Biology minor in May 2025
            at <span>Skidmore College</span> while also being a key player on the women's basketball team for four years. My interest of programming began during high school, and my passion for it was strong enough to 
            lead me to further exploration in college. Beyond academics I enjoy running, fishing, pretty sunsets, and training and walking dogs.
