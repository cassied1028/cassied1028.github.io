        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p >Hello, I'm Cassie! As I begin junior year of college, I'm pursuing a dual passion as a 
            Computer Science Major and Biology Minor at Skidmore College. 
            My interest of programming began during high school, and my passion for it was strong enough to 
            lead me to further exploration in college. 
            <br><br>I've actively engaged in computer science research both during the school year as well as over 
            the summer. These experiences have led me to participate in and present at poster presentations. 
            Through this, I have not only honed my collaboration skills but have also improved individual 
            research skills.   
            <br><br>Beyond academics, I'm also a dedicated student-athlete, contributing my skills to the women's 
            basketball team here at Skidmore. Being a part of this team has helped me maintain structure with
             my work. Good communication skills have played a vital role in creating a cohesive and 
             successful team dynamic both on the court and in the class.
